# Introduction

A well-organized file structure is the backbone of our project "Tongue Twisters Challenge." It is designed to support a smooth development process, encourage collaboration among team members, and ensure that every piece of the project fits perfectly together for maximum efficiency. This project helps children with speech impediments practice tongue twisters to improve their speech clarity. The clear hierarchy and naming conventions in our file structure make it easier for anyone, regardless of their technical background, to find what they need.

# Overview of the Tech Stack

The project uses modern, efficient technologies to deliver both great performance and ease of maintenance. Our frontend is built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons to ensure a clean and minimalistic user interface. On the backend, we utilize Supabase for database management and Clerk for secure user authentication. The project also leverages the Google Speech-to-Text API for real-time speech analysis and integrated AI feedback. This blend of technologies influences how our files are organized; with clear separations between frontend and backend code, configuration files, and documentation, every component of our app is logically placed.

# Root Directory Structure

At the root level of the project you will find several key directories and files that form the foundation of our application. The main directories include the source folder (commonly named 'src'), which contains all the code for components, pages, utilities, and styling; a public directory where static assets like images and fonts are stored; and a documentation directory for all internal and external documentations. Files such as the main configuration files (for example, the Next.js configuration file, TypeScript configuration file, and package.json) reside directly in the root directory. This logical grouping ensures that configuration settings, code, and documentation are easy to access and maintain.

# Configuration and Environment Files

The configuration files and environment settings are crucial to setting up and managing our project environment. In our file structure, you will find environment files like '.env.local' that store environment-specific variables. Files such as 'next.config.js' and 'tsconfig.json' dictate how Next.js and TypeScript handle the project build process, respectively. Package management is handled via files like 'package.json' and 'yarn.lock' or 'package-lock.json', which ensure that all dependencies are managed in a central location. In a nutshell, these files help manage both the local development environment and the deployment process, ensuring that every setting is defined and accessible in one central spot.

# Documentation Structure

Documentation is organized in its own dedicated directory to facilitate easy access and thorough understanding of the project. Within this documentation folder, you will find files such as the primary README.md, project requirements documents, technical specifications, and implementation plans. In addition, any additional documents like user guides and API references are stored here as well. This structure not only supports quality assurance but also encourages easy knowledge sharing among team members. Keeping documentation separate from code ensures that updates to either area do not interfere with the other while still providing a holistic view of the project for new contributors and stakeholders alike.

# Conclusion and Overall Summary

In summary, the file structure for the Tongue Twisters Challenge project reflects a balanced organization that supports efficient development, maintenance, and collaboration. With a clear segregation between source code, configuration, assets, and documentation, every piece of the project is placed where it can be easily found and managed. This approach not only simplifies navigation for developers but also ensures that non-technical stakeholders can understand the overall layout of the project. This carefully crafted file organization sets the foundation for future expansion, scalability, and ease of onboarding new team members while supporting the unique needs of the project.

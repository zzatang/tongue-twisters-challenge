**Phase 3: Backend Development**

11. Set up Supabase as the database and backend storage:
    - Create necessary tables in Supabase:
      - `tongue_twisters` table with fields: id (UUID), text (string), difficulty (ENUM: 'Easy', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'), and metadata.
      - `user_progress` table with fields: id, user_id, practice_frequency, clarity_score, total_practice_time, badges (JSON or array).
    - Configure Supabase client in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using the provided credentials.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 5. Tech Stack & Tools - Supabase]

12. Configure Clerk integration on the backend for secure user data. 
    - Update the Next.js middleware or API routes to use Clerk’s authentication hooks.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - User Authentication & Accounts] & [Tech Stack: Clerk]

13. Build a Next.js API route for speech analysis in `/pages/api/speech.ts`:
    - This endpoint will receive audio data from the client, forward it to Google Speech-to-Text API, and return analysis results with pronunciation accuracy and improvement tips.
    - Ensure secure handling of API keys and error reporting.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Real-Time Speech Analysis] & [Tech Stack: Google Speech-to-Text API]

14. **Validation**: Test the `/api/speech` endpoint using a tool like Postman or `curl` by sending sample audio data and verifying that a well-structured JSON response is obtained. ✅

---

**Phase 4: Integration**

15. Connect the Practice page UI to the `/api/speech` endpoint using front-end API calls (e.g., `fetch` or Axios).
    - In `/pages/practice/[tongueId].tsx`, add functionality for recording audio and then sending it to the speech API.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 3. User Flow]

16. Integrate Supabase calls in the Dashboard page to fetch tongue twister tiles and user progress data.
    - Use the Supabase client created in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` for database queries.
    - Reference: [PRD Sections 4 and 5: Core Features - Dashboard & Progress Tracking]

17. Integrate gamification elements:
    - In the Dashboard, display earned badges or rewards alongside practice metrics.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Gamification Elements]

18. **Validation**: Perform end-to-end testing by simulating a user flow: register, choose a tongue twister, record a session, receive feedback, and view updated progress metrics. ✅

---

**Phase 5: Deployment**

19. Deploy the Next.js application on Vercel:
    - Ensure environment variables for Supabase, Clerk, and Google Speech-to-Text API are correctly added in Vercel dashboard.
    - Reference: [Tech Stack: Next.js 14] & [PRD Section 2. In-Scope]

20. Set up deployment pipeline using Windsurf’s integrated AI coding and debugging tools for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
    - Commit code to `main` and monitor automated builds and deployments in Vercel.
    - Reference: [Windsurf File] (Modern IDE integration)

21. **Validation**: After deployment, manually test key routes (sign-in, dashboard, practice session, feedback API) on the production URL and verify performance meets the 1–2 second response requirement. ✅

---

**Phase 6: Post-Launch**

22. Establish monitoring for Supabase and API endpoints:
    - Set up logging and error tracking (e.g., using Vercel Analytics and Supabase’s monitoring tools) to catch API rate limit or performance issues.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 6. Non-Functional Requirements]

23. Schedule monthly updates for tongue twisters content in Supabase:
    - Create a plan/task for the content team to add/update records in the `tongue_twisters` table.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Curated Content Management]

24. Plan for periodic reviews of user feedback on the speech analysis and gamification experience to inform future iterations, including scalability improvements and potential integration of advanced privacy measures.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 7: Constraints & Assumptions]

25. **Validation**: Perform load testing (optionally using a tool like Locust) to simulate concurrent users and confirm the system sustains a high uptime and responsive UI under increased load. ✅

---

**Edge Case Handling & Additional Considerations**

26. In the `/pages/api/speech.ts` endpoint, implement retry logic (3 retries with 2-second delay) if calls to Google Speech-to-Text API fail.
    - Reference: [Q&A: Specific Third-Party AI Services]

27. Implement a fallback UI component at `/pages/404.tsx` with a friendly “Return Home” button in case of navigation errors or undefined routes.
    - Reference: [App Flow Document: Error States]

28. **Validation**: Manually test scenarios where the speech API fails and verify that the retry logic and error messages appear, and the 404 page works when navigating to an invalid route. ✅

This comprehensive step-by-step plan is designed to implement the Tongue Twisters Challenge platform by following all specified requirements and using the recommended tech stack and tools.

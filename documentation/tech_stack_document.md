# Introduction

Tongue Twisters Challenge is a web-based platform designed to help children with speech impediments improve their articulation by practicing engaging tongue twisters. The platform focuses on a clean, minimalistic interface, secure user accounts, and real-time speech analysis that offers immediate feedback and personalized tips to enhance speech clarity. By using a thoughtful combination of modern technologies, this project aims to make practice both effective and fun, leveraging gamification elements such as badges to motivate continued improvement.

# Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the application is built using Next.js 14 and TypeScript, ensuring a modern and robust framework that allows for both efficient server-side rendering and a dynamic client-side experience. Tailwind CSS is utilized for rapid and responsive styling, providing a clean and minimalistic aesthetic that is friendly for children. Additionally, shadcn/UI and Radix UI supply accessible, customizable components that guarantee a consistent and user-friendly interface, while Lucide Icons contribute to modern and clear iconography that enhances navigation and visual appeal. These choices in technology collectively ensure that the user experience is smooth, intuitive, and visually engaging, especially for young users learning through practice.

# Backend Technologies

For the backend, Supabase is employed as the database and storage solution. Supabase provides a simple, secure, and scalable environment for storing user data and progress metrics. On the authentication front, Clerk handles secure user sign-up and sign-in, offering both email-based and Google authentication. This combination not only secures sensitive user data but also supports smooth account management. Together, these backend technologies create a reliable foundation that supports the core functionalities of the platform, from user management to storing progress and feedback data.

# Infrastructure and Deployment

The decision to use modern hosting platforms and integrated development tools underpins the platform's reliability and scalability. The project leverages cloud hosting services that work seamlessly with Supabase for backend operations, ensuring that the application remains responsive even as the number of users grows. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are in place to automate testing and deployment processes, thereby ensuring that updates are delivered swiftly and safely. Version control systems maintain a history of code changes, enabling easy tracking and collaboration among developers. These infrastructure choices contribute to an overall robust deployment strategy that supports both current functionality and future scalability.

# Third-Party Integrations

To power its speech recognition and feedback system, Tongue Twisters Challenge integrates Google’s Speech-to-Text API. This industry-standard tool is responsible for analyzing user speech in real time, identifying mispronounced words, and providing actionable feedback on pronunciation clarity. By leveraging such a trusted third-party service, the platform ensures high accuracy in feedback and the ability to offer immediate and clear improvement tips. Furthermore, the integration of Windsurf, a modern IDE with integrated AI coding capabilities, aids developers in crafting high-quality code, debugging issues, and maintaining code standards throughout the project lifecycle.

# Security and Performance Considerations

Security measures have been carefully planned to safeguard user data, especially during account creation and when storing user feedback and progress. While advanced privacy controls for voice recordings are deferred for future phases, the use of Clerk for authentication and Supabase for secure data storage establishes a solid baseline for data protection. Performance is equally crucial; the tech stack is optimized to deliver interactions and feedback swiftly, ensuring that the processing of real-time speech data via Google’s Speech-to-Text API happens within seconds. Together, these approaches ensure that both security and performance are prioritized, creating a reliable platform that remains responsive under load.

# Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technological choices for Tongue Twisters Challenge have been carefully made to align with the project’s goal of providing effective, fun, and secure speech improvement practice for children with speech impediments. The frontend is powered by Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons to ensure a modern, responsive, and accessible interface. On the backend, Supabase and Clerk offer a secure and scalable environment for managing user data and authentication. The integration of Google’s Speech-to-Text API enables robust, real-time feedback, while tools like Windsurf support efficient development workflows. This well-rounded tech stack not only meets the current needs of the project but also lays a strong foundation for future enhancements, ensuring that Tongue Twisters Challenge remains both innovative and user-centric.

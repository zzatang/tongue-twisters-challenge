**Phase 1: Environment Setup**

1. Install Node.js (ensure compatibility with Next.js 14) and set up a new Next.js project using TypeScript. 
   - Command: `npx create-next-app@latest tongue-twisters-challenge --ts`
   - Reference: [Tech Stack: Frontend] & [PRD Section 1. Project Overview]

   DONE (2025-02-16):
   - Verified existing Next.js 14 project setup with TypeScript
   - Fixed development server startup issues by:
     1. Clearing Next.js cache (removed .next directory)
     2. Cleaning npm cache
     3. Reinstalling dependencies
   - Confirmed working development server at http://localhost:3000
   - Project includes all required dependencies:
     - Next.js 14 with App Router
     - TypeScript
     - Tailwind CSS
     - Clerk for authentication
     - Supabase for database
     - Radix UI components

2. Initialize a Git repository in the project root with branches `main` and `dev`. 
   - Create repository structure with directories:
     - `/pages` (Next.js pages for routes)
     - `/components` (React components, e.g., Dashboard, Practice, Feedback)
     - `/styles` (Tailwind CSS configurations)
     - `/lib` (for backend integrations like Supabase and Clerk clients)
   - Reference: [PRD Section 1. Overview]

   DONE (2025-02-16):
   - Verified existing Git repository with `main` branch
   - Created and switched to new `dev` branch
   - Confirmed existing directory structure:
     - `/app` (Next.js 14 App Router directory, replacing `/pages` as per modern Next.js conventions)
     - `/components` (React components)
     - `/lib` (backend integrations)
     - `/public` (static files)
     - `/utils` (utility functions)
     - `/hooks` (custom React hooks)
     - `/types` (TypeScript type definitions)
     - `/supabase` (Supabase configurations)
   - Created `/styles` directory with `tailwind.css` for custom Tailwind configurations
     and component styles
   - Note: Project follows Next.js 14 App Router structure instead of Pages Router, 
     so `/pages` directory is not needed as specified in `.windsurfrules`

3. Configure Tailwind CSS by following the official setup for Next.js with Tailwind. 
   - Create/configure `tailwind.config.js` in the project root.
   - Reference: [Tech Stack: Tailwind CSS]

   DONE (2025-02-16):
   - Verified existing Tailwind CSS configuration:
     - `tailwind.config.ts` with comprehensive setup:
       - Content paths for components and pages
       - Extended theme with custom colors and animations
       - Dark mode support
       - Design tokens for consistent styling
     - `postcss.config.mjs` with Tailwind plugin
     - Global styles in `/app/globals.css`
     - Component styles in `/styles/tailwind.css`
   - Configuration supports all required features:
     - Custom color schemes
     - Responsive design
     - Component-level styling
     - Animations and transitions
     - Dark mode

4. **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` and verify that the default Next.js page loads without errors.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development**

5. Set up authentication pages using Clerk for email and Google-based registration.
   - Create `/pages/signin.tsx` and `/pages/signup.tsx` that import Clerk’s authentication widgets.
   - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - User Authentication & Accounts] and [Tech Stack: Clerk]

6. Develop the Dashboard page at `/pages/index.tsx` to display tongue twister tiles. 
   - Incorporate filtering options for difficulty levels (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced).
   - Use components from shadcn/UI and Radix UI, and icons from Lucide Icons.
   - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Dashboard with Tongue Twister Tiles]

7. Build a dynamic Practice page: 
   - Create a dynamic route `/pages/practice/[tongueId].tsx` to load a selected tongue twister.
   - Include UI elements: a recording button to start the speech recording, a visual indicator for listening, and a display area for real-time feedback.
   - Reference: [App Flow Document] & [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Real-Time Speech Analysis]

8. Develop a Feedback component in `/components/Feedback.tsx` to show feedback details (clarity score, mispronounced words, and improvement tips). 
   - The component will receive API responses and display them clearly.
   - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Real-Time Speech Analysis]

9. Implement a Progress Dashboard page at `/pages/dashboard.tsx` that:
   - Retrieves and shows metrics like practice frequency, clarity improvements, total practice time, and gamification badges.
   - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Progress Tracking Dashboard]

10. **Validation**: Run frontend tests (e.g., using Jest and React Testing Library) on key components such as the Dashboard, Practice, and Feedback components to ensure UI functionality and error-free rendering.

---

**Phase 3: Backend Development**

11. Set up Supabase as the database and backend storage:
    - Create necessary tables in Supabase:
      - `tongue_twisters` table with fields: id (UUID), text (string), difficulty (ENUM: 'Easy', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'), and metadata.
      - `user_progress` table with fields: id, user_id, practice_frequency, clarity_score, total_practice_time, badges (JSON or array).
    - Configure Supabase client in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using the provided credentials.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 5. Tech Stack & Tools - Supabase]

12. Configure Clerk integration on the backend for secure user data. 
    - Update the Next.js middleware or API routes to use Clerk’s authentication hooks.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - User Authentication & Accounts] & [Tech Stack: Clerk]

13. Build a Next.js API route for speech analysis in `/pages/api/speech.ts`:
    - This endpoint will receive audio data from the client, forward it to Google Speech-to-Text API, and return analysis results with pronunciation accuracy and improvement tips.
    - Ensure secure handling of API keys and error reporting.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Real-Time Speech Analysis] & [Tech Stack: Google Speech-to-Text API]

14. **Validation**: Test the `/api/speech` endpoint using a tool like Postman or `curl` by sending sample audio data and verifying that a well-structured JSON response is obtained.

---

**Phase 4: Integration**

15. Connect the Practice page UI to the `/api/speech` endpoint using front-end API calls (e.g., `fetch` or Axios).
    - In `/pages/practice/[tongueId].tsx`, add functionality for recording audio and then sending it to the speech API.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 3. User Flow]

16. Integrate Supabase calls in the Dashboard page to fetch tongue twister tiles and user progress data.
    - Use the Supabase client created in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` for database queries.
    - Reference: [PRD Sections 4 and 5: Core Features - Dashboard & Progress Tracking]

17. Integrate gamification elements:
    - In the Dashboard, display earned badges or rewards alongside practice metrics.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Gamification Elements]

18. **Validation**: Perform end-to-end testing by simulating a user flow: register, choose a tongue twister, record a session, receive feedback, and view updated progress metrics.

---

**Phase 5: Deployment**

19. Deploy the Next.js application on Vercel:
    - Ensure environment variables for Supabase, Clerk, and Google Speech-to-Text API are correctly added in Vercel dashboard.
    - Reference: [Tech Stack: Next.js 14] & [PRD Section 2. In-Scope]

20. Set up deployment pipeline using Windsurf’s integrated AI coding and debugging tools for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
    - Commit code to `main` and monitor automated builds and deployments in Vercel.
    - Reference: [Windsurf File] (Modern IDE integration)

21. **Validation**: After deployment, manually test key routes (sign-in, dashboard, practice session, feedback API) on the production URL and verify performance meets the 1–2 second response requirement.

---

**Phase 6: Post-Launch**

22. Establish monitoring for Supabase and API endpoints:
    - Set up logging and error tracking (e.g., using Vercel Analytics and Supabase’s monitoring tools) to catch API rate limit or performance issues.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 6. Non-Functional Requirements]

23. Schedule monthly updates for tongue twisters content in Supabase:
    - Create a plan/task for the content team to add/update records in the `tongue_twisters` table.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 4. Core Features - Curated Content Management]

24. Plan for periodic reviews of user feedback on the speech analysis and gamification experience to inform future iterations, including scalability improvements and potential integration of advanced privacy measures.
    - Reference: [PRD Section 7: Constraints & Assumptions]

25. **Validation**: Perform load testing (optionally using a tool like Locust) to simulate concurrent users and confirm the system sustains a high uptime and responsive UI under increased load.

---

**Edge Case Handling & Additional Considerations**

26. In the `/pages/api/speech.ts` endpoint, implement retry logic (3 retries with 2-second delay) if calls to Google Speech-to-Text API fail.
    - Reference: [Q&A: Specific Third-Party AI Services]

27. Implement a fallback UI component at `/pages/404.tsx` with a friendly “Return Home” button in case of navigation errors or undefined routes.
    - Reference: [App Flow Document: Error States]

28. **Validation**: Manually test scenarios where the speech API fails and verify that the retry logic and error messages appear, and the 404 page works when navigating to an invalid route.

This comprehensive step-by-step plan is designed to implement the Tongue Twisters Challenge platform by following all specified requirements and using the recommended tech stack and tools.
